# Game Rules  

Texas_Holdem is a 4 person, limited version of [Texas Hold'em](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/basics-of-poker/) (a popular variant of Poker).  

## Equipment:
Texas_Holdem requires:

1. A standard 52-card deck
2. An accepted form of currency (can be Candy, Money, etc.)

## Game Play:    
Each Player begins with $1000 and receives 2 cards at the beginning of each round. Players, when it is their turn, can choose to:

1. check (Bet nothing and pass player turn as long as a prior bet has not been made the same turn)
2. fold (Leave previously bet money in the pot, give up cards, and stop play)
3. bet (add money to community pot {call/raise} and continue play)

There are two rounds of betting. Before the community cards are displayed and after the community cards are displayed. If all but one player remains in play due to folding, the remaining player takes the cumulative money in the pot. If there are multiple people remaining after the second round of betting, then whoever has the highest ranking hand receives the entirety of the pot.

#### Hand Ranks:

1. **Royal flush**. A, K, Q, J, 10, all the same suit.
